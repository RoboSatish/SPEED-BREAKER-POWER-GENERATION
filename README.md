# SPEED-BREAKER-POWER-GENERATION
Energy is the primary need for survival of all organisms in the universe. Everything what happens in the surrounding is the expression of flow of energy in one of the forms. But in this fast moving world, population is increasing day by day and the conventional energy sources are lessening. The extensive usage of energy has resulted in an energy crisis over the few years. Therefore to overcome this problem we need to implement the techniques of optimal utilization of conventional sources for conservation of energy. My paper includes how to utilize the energy which is wasted when the vehicles passes over a speed breaker. Lots of energy is generated when vehicle passes over it. We can tap the energy generated and produce power by using the speed breaker as power generating unit. The kinetic energy of the moving vehicles can be converted into mechanical energy of the shaft through rack and pinion mechanism. Then, this mechanical energy will be converted to electrical energy using generator which will be saved with the use of a battery. The energy we save during the day light can be used in the night time for lighting street lights. Therefore, by using this arrangement we can save lot of energy which can be used for the fulfillment of future demand.
